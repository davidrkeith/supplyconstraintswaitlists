## Abstract:
Constraints on the ability to adjust production capacity present a strategic and operational problem for managers launching products when demand is uncertain. Recently, researchers have considered the role of supply constraints in new product diffusion, analyzing launch strategies to minimize costly stock-outs when demand exceeds supply, leading to waitlists and lost sales. Waitlists, while associated with supply constraints, have a further effect on dif-fusion by influencing demand through the generation of social exposure. In this paper we demonstrate first that measures of inventory availability, a common proxy for waitlists, are not sufficient to quantify the extent of waitlists. We then generalize supply constraints diffu-sion models, explicitly accounting for endogenous customer waitlisting and waitlist word-of-mouth when demand exceeds supply. Applying the model to a prominent example of waitlist-ing during new product launch, we find evidence of positive word-of-mouth from waitlisted buyers, altering the estimated contribution of marketing and adopter word-of-mouth.
